<h2>Clearfix</h2>

<p> The following example contains an image whose height is larger than the box surrounding it, hence the image overflows out of its box:</p>

<div>
  <img class="img1" src="imgs/alicorn.jpg" alt="alicorn" width="170" height="170">
  Here is a gorgeous flying unicorn anyone would be happy to have as a best friend...
</div>

<p style="clear:right">
  Now that we are adding <i>clearfix</i> class with <i>overflow:auto</i> as property & value the aforementioned concern is addressed:
 </p>

<div class="clearfix">
  <img class="img1" src="imgs/alicorn.jpg" alt="alicorn" width="170" height="170">
  Here is a gorgeous flying unicorn anyone would be happy to have as a best friend...
</div>


<p style="clear:right">
  A better solution that is more modern to <i>clearfix</i> is adding <i>display: flowroot</i> to the enclosing box :
 </p>

<div id="with_display_flowroot">
  <img class="img1" src="imgs/alicorn.jpg" alt="alicorn" width="170" height="170">
  Here is a gorgeous flying unicorn anyone would be happy to have as a best friend...
</div>
